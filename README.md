# NLP_Sentiment_Twitter
a collection of ipython notebooks for mining tweets and performing natural language processing for sentiment. Focus on D.C. politicians.

I've written a blog post on the results, which may be found at: https://lynchklablog.wordpress.com/2017/05/26/the-president-tweets-like-a-democratic-senator/

Follow up blog post at: https://lynchklablog.wordpress.com/2017/05/30/follow-up-a-tale-of-two-presidential-twitter-handles-realdonaldtrump-vs-potus/

2 main results of the work. First, tacking the sentiment of Pres. Trump's Tweets over time. In particular, observing how the official POTUS account is substantially more positive than the personal account:

And observing the sentiment of the president vs senators from both parties, showing the President's sentiment is more in line with the Democratic senators:
